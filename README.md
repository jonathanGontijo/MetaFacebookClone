# Project | Meta Facebook Clone

In this project I created a “Meta/Facebook” clone Interface with a responsive layout to desktop and smartphone.


Facebook desktop.

He has 3 columns, in the first there is a listViewBuild with icons and text, in the second column I pass a horizontal scrollView to show all stories, and bellow a hintText to share some status, after this I throwback the list of posts using a listViewBuild. And in the last column there is another listViewBuild with the list of contacts.

Facebook Mobile page.

In mobile layout there is just one column where I pass the horizontal scrollView with the stories, and bellow a listViewBuild with a list of posts.
